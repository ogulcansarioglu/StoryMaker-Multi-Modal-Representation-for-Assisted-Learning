# StoryMaker-Automated-Multi-Modal-Representation-And-Context-Aware-Chatboxs-for-Assisted-Learning
StoryMaker is a progressive web application that creates illustrated audiobooks for free, using generative AIs. It also provides interactive chatboxes, assuming the identiy of characters in the book, that user can have a conversation with. 

This is both intended as a educational and personal tool. 

It's integrated with Gutenberg that means user can get any copywrite free books online easly to use with Storymaker. 

There is also a create-your-own-story mode, where users can create and illustrate their own stories using LLMs. 

# Current Status

I am not allowed to share the StoryMaker code since it's going under educational and business reviews. I hope to open source it after they are done.
